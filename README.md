# Toy RSA Implementation

Disclaimer: ** THIS IS A TOY PROJECT.  THIS IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RSA PROTOCOL IS NOT SECURE AND IS MISSING VITUAL SECURITY FEATURES.  FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. **

This project includes:
- An RSA key generator.
- A Flask server which listens for incoming encrypted messages.
- A client which sends encrypted messages to the above server.

The inspiration and theory which has gone into the project can be found in *'Understanding Cryptography', A Textbook for Students and Practitioners by Christof Paar, Jan Pelzl, Bart Preneel (ISBN: 8601406549616)*.
